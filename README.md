# Graphic Know-Vels

### A Graphic Novel Exploration and Curation App

Graphic Know-vels is an application to help graphic novel readers navigate, explore, annote, and save personal collections of these novels. Graphic novels are books comprised of many different comics and these collections can be complex involving many different characters, different series, and different lines of comics all within the same graphic novel. Our application makes navigating this complexity easier and more rewarding.

### Organization

This MERN stack app uses React to render our Material-ui front end, a Mongo database with Mongoose, we're using Express for routing purposes, and finally Node and javascript make the world go round. The user views a single page application, available to all users with additional value and functionality when users sign up/sign in.

### How-to operate

Simply visit: https://shrouded-taiga-88482.herokuapp.com/
and visit our application hosted generously on Heroku! Our landing page presents you with the ability to optionally sign up/login, but our core functionality is available to all users. The landing page displays the database collection of Characters as the entrance to exploring graphic novels, in addition, relevant comic book news is displayed, and a notetaking feature. Selecting a character will display more information on the character, picture, links to additional information, and a list of linked graphic novel series. The series' each link to the volumes specific to that character, and the volumes each contain a link to a modal that displays additional information, provided by the Google Books API.
